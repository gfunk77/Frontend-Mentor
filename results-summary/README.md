## Overview

This is a solution to the [Results Summary challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV)

Initially I built this project with normal html markup. As I was adding in the JavaScript, I was just having fun removing more and more of the html. This final result does not represent best practices in JS. That wasn't my goal here.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
